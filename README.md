Project Overview: 

This goal of this project was to design, manufacture and program an interactive card dealer. The final design is presented on the webpage provided below, and the program is included in this repository.  This arduino file is for use with an Arduino Mega Microcontroller, and programs the device to operate the daeler in accordance to player inputs. The dealer allows for five card games, including Texas Holdem, Blackjack, Five Card Draw, Casino War, and Go Fish. RFID technology is used to provide card information to the arduino board.
